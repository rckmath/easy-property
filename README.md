## Background

Easy Property is my first hands on into a solidity smart contract app started with academic purposes as a project for the Distribute Systems subject of my software engineering graduation.

This isn't a real application and it's only a personal study as a lover of blockchain and cryptocurrencies that I am.

## Technologies

- :star: [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/) as the smart contract programming language
- :star: [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) as the contract deploy framework
- :star: [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) as a quick run local blockchain for development
- :star: [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) as the frontend javascript user interface library
- :star: [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) as the API provider and user's wallet
